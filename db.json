In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talent: or you might accomplish the opposite --- inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power."

        "body": "Be wary of friends ---- they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them."

Guide them far enough down the  wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late."

        "body": "When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open—ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish."

Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them."
